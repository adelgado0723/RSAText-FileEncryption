# RSA Text-File Encryption

- The RSA algorithm for encryption draws its strength from the *Fundamental
  Theorem Of Arithmetic*, which states that any positive integer either is a
  prime number or can be uniquely represented as a product of prime numbers.

- In order to *crack* the encryption provided by the RSA algorithm, one
  must attempt to factor a very large number into its unique prime
  constituents; a lengthy process with no straight-forward easy solution
